# fresh-eats

The goal of this project is to design the layout for a meal delivery service.

I researched existing sites that offered the same type of service.
This project was challenging and test my newly aquired understanding of flexbox.

I plan to return to this project to update and improve it.
The best part of this project was gaining experience using the webpack template authored by Rachel Manning.

This project is a work in progress.
